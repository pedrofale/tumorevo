# Simulating tumor evolution
We implement a simulation engine for tumor evolution based on Noble et al, 2019.
Our aim is to generate phylogenetic trees and lightwight images of tumors under different spatial constraints.

The main diference to demon is the images that we generate. We dont want ugly grids of demes, but something more... organic?
